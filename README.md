### Formats

Note: The specification is offered in two data interchange formats (JSON and YAML) and two specification structure format (Bundled and Dereferenced)

* **Bundled** files make use of OpenAPI components and references for reuse and to minimise filesize, this is the recommended format.
* **Dereferenced** files are generated without any references which results in a larger filesize due to repeat data and is mainly for tools that don't offer support for OpenAPI references.

| Format | |

| JSON   | [Bundled](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ticketsource/openapi-spec/main/reference/TicketSource-API.json) - [Dereferenced](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ticketsource/openapi-spec/main/reference/dereferenced/TicketSource-API.json)
| YAML   | [Bundled](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ticketsource/openapi-spec/main/reference/TicketSource-API.yaml) - [Dereferenced](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ticketsource/openapi-spec/main/reference/dereferenced/TicketSource-API.yaml)
